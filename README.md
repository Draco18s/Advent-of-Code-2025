*Note: AoC no longer has a global leaderboard. As such I'll be recording my times under my friend-group schema where part 2's time does not include part 1's (and where part 1 estimates a starting time based on group median completion time).*

```
      --------Part 1---------   --------Part 2---------
Day       Time    Rank  Score       Time    Rank  Score
 1    00:26:21      NA      -   00:24:21      NA      -
 2    00:04:21      NA      -   00:06:52      NA      -
 3    00:06:09      NA      -   00:49:58      NA      -
 4    00:11:53      NA      -   00:01:35      NA      -
 
```

*Day 1: My "new" phone is still bad at day light savings time, so my alarm didn't go off. Got started about 15 minutes later...and didn't have the project pre-setup.*
*Day 2: Still didn't start on time. Completion time estimated based on starting 1hr 6m late.*
*Day 4: Misread `<` as `<=`*
