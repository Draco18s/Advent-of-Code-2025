*Note: AoC no longer has a global leaderboard. As such I'll be recording my times under my friend-group schema where part 2's time does not include part 1's (and where part 1 estimates a starting time based on group median completion time--or my own manual approximations when neccessary).*

*Day 1: My "new" phone is still bad at day light savings time, so my alarm didn't go off. Got started about 15 minutes later...and didn't have the project pre-setup.*  
*Day 2: Still didn't start on time. Completion time estimated based on starting 1hr 6m late.*  
*Day 4: Misread `<` as `<=`*  
*Day 5: Started 15ish minutes late because of board game night.*  
*Day 7: Integer overflow that took far too long to notice.*  
*Day 8: Integer overflow caught me out again, I even had the right answer printed as X \* Y and didn't double check it...Should have only taken ~8 minutes*  
*Day 9: Part 2. What the beans. I have an answer, but its apparently wrong, can't find the edge case. An edge case that most people don't have to deal with, apparently.*  
*Day 10: Woof. In progress... Part 1 is done, time above is not remotely accurate. I'll have to work out a more reflective time-spent by hand.*  
*Day 11: Need some memoization for part 2. Need to find the last time I used it to figure out how to deal with this.*
